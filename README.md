# AES-128
<p>Single module implementation of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES-128 - variant of the Rijndael block cipher), supports "DEFAULT", "FAST" and "TINY" configuration. Configuration "DEFAULT" takes 50 clock cycles to complete, "FAST" takes 20 clock cycles and "TINY" takes 176 clock cycles. The AES specification was published by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) as U.S. FIPS PUB 197 (FIPS 197) in 2001, updated in 2023.</p>
<p>Verified with Intel&reg; Cyclone&reg; 10 LP Evaluation Kit at 125MHz.</p>
